Scroggie, M.P., Forsyth, D.F., McPhee, S., Matthews, J., Stuart, I.G., Stamation, K.A., Lindeman, M. & Ramsey, D.S.L. (2018) Invasive prey controlling invasive predators? European rabbit abundance does not determine red fox population dynamics. *Journal of Applied Ecology*

This repository contains all data and code necessary to replicate the results of the analysis presented in the paper. 

The model is fitted using *R* and *JAGS* so installation of current versions of those software packages will be necessary, along with several *R* packages such as *dplyr, ggplot2, ggmcmc, gridExtra, knitr, rmarkdown, readr, tidyr, stringr, rjags and jagsUI*.

The manuscript is compiled to a pdf from Rmarkdown using pandoc and latex, so these will be required also.
