For this model we will try to adapt the rabbit abundance model code from: 

Scroggie, M.P., Forsyth, D.F., McPhee, S., Matthews, J., Stuart, I.G., Stamation, K.A., Lindeman, M. & Ramsey, D.S.L. (2018) Invasive prey controlling invasive predators? European rabbit abundance does not determine red fox population dynamics. *Journal of Applied Ecology*
