This repository contains data, models and interpretation of rabbit spotlight count data for the mallee parks of north west Victoria. 

We will try to adapt the rabbit abundance model code described in: 

Scroggie, M.P., Forsyth, D.F., McPhee, S., Matthews, J., Stuart, I.G., Stamation, K.A., Lindeman, M. & Ramsey, D.S.L. (2018) Invasive prey controlling invasive predators? European rabbit abundance does not determine red fox population dynamics. *Journal of Applied Ecology*

To that end, our starting point is to fork Scrogster's own repository.
