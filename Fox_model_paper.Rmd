#Abstract

1. Invasive mammalian predators commonly co-exist with invasive mammalian herbivore prey. Managers often advocate controlling invasive prey in the belief that this will also reduce invasive predator abundance. Such an outcome would have desirable ecological and financial benefits, but there have been few tests of this hypothesis. 

2. We used large-scale and long-term monitoring data to test the prediction that invasive red fox *(Vulpes vulpes)* populations decline following control of invasive European rabbit *(Oryctolagus cuniculus)* populations in Australia. Both species severely impact natural and agricultural ecosystems, and significant resources are expended reducing these impacts. We fitted a hierarchical state-space model to spotlight counts of both species conducted at 21 transects between 1998 and 2016. The effects of rainfall and density dependence on the population growth rates of both species were also evaluated.

3. Control activities (warren ripping and surface harbor removal) at 18 of the sites substantially reduced the average abundance rabbit populations. Rabbit populations showed little response to rainfall, but exhibited negative density-dependence and greater rates of increase during the autumn-spring interval.

4. There was no numerical response of foxes to changes in rabbit abundance. Rather, fox populations increased rapidly after high rainfall, and exhibited negative density-dependence. The equilibrium abundance of foxes varied with rainfall and season, but was always < 0.2 foxes per spotlight km.

5. *Synthesis and applications* We conclude that controlling rabbits to low abundances does not substantially reduce fox abundances in south-eastern Australia. Rather, managers wanting to reduce fox abundances should conduct targeted control of fox populations. Managers of invasive predator -- invasive prey systems should not assume that controlling prey will, by itself, reduce predator abundances. Quantifying the numerical response is critical for understanding the likely response of predators to changes in prey abundance.

#Introduction

Invasive mammalian predators commonly co-exist with invasive mammalian herbivore prey. Eradication of invasive mammalian predators and prey is currently feasible for smaller islands [@bode2015eradicating], but for larger islands and continents sustained control to low densities is the only feasible management option [@ruscoe2011unexpected; @glen2013eradicating].

There are usually insufficient resources to conduct sustained control of multiple invasive taxa over large areas, and hence a key question for managers is the extent to which controlling the predator or the prey affects the abundance of the other species [@bergstrom2009indirect; @bode2015eradicating]. Because of the typically much smaller home-ranges of mammalian prey compared to predators, this question can be addressed using field experiments in which free-living predators have access to some experimental units containing prey but not others [@pech1992limits].  Field experiments that exclude mammalian predators sometimes demonstrate significant increases in mammalian prey [@krebs1995impact; @salo2010predator], although the responses in invasive predator-prey systems are often weak or non-existent  [@pech1992limits; @davey2006exotic]. Bottom-up processes such as food availability, often have stronger positive effects on mammalian prey abundances than the negative effect of mammalian predators [@krebs1995impact].

In contrast, the abundance of mammalian predators is believed to be primarily determined by food availability ("bottom-up"), although there could be a ceiling on this effect due to territorial spacing or other behavioural constraints on abundance at high densities [@lindstrom1989food; @cariappa2011reappraisal]. If bottom-up processes truly dominate the growth of invasive predator populations, then this mechanism could be exploited to achieve management control of predator abundance by first controlling prey abundances to low levels, which in turn will limit the ability of predators to increase in numbers, or at least make predator populations more susceptible to other control actions [@norbury2017bottomup; @courchamp1999control].

Mammalian predators often operate at large spatial and temporal scales, and hence experiments to test hypotheses about the ecological processes driving their abundances are practically and financially difficult to implement [@krebs1995impact]. Statistical analysis of long-term monitoring data from predator-prey systems provides an alternative approach to testing hypotheses about the outcomes of predator-prey interaction [e.g. @dennis2000joint]. These monitoring data can be used to quantify the numerical response between predator and prey [@bayliss2002numerical]. An advantage of this approach is that other potentially important population processes such as density-dependence [@brook2006strength], effects of management interventions, and temporally and spatially varying influences such as rainfall [@dennis2000joint] can be included.

The European rabbit *(Oryctolagus cuniculus)*  and red fox *(Vulpes vulpes)* were introduced to Australia in the 19th century, and are now sympatric over the majority of mainland Australia, with both species being serious threats to agriculture and biodiversity [@cooke2012rabbits; @saunders2010impacts]. Substantial effort is expended on the control of both species using conventional control [@reddiex2007control]. Two biological control agents (myxoma virus and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus, hereafter RHDV) have also been established to control rabbits [@mutze2008geographic; @mutze2010effect].  Because rabbits are a major component of fox diet in south-eastern Australia [@davis_foxdiet] there is much interest in understanding the interactions between these species [@Pech_alternativeprey; @norbury2015pests], and in exploiting these interactions to maximise the effectiveness of management for achieving agricultural production and native biodiversity outcomes [@pedler2016rabbit].

Of particular management interest is the effect of controlling rabbits to low densities (either through conventional or biological control) on fox populations [@pech1992limits; @holden2003impact]. If controlling rabbits to low densities results in substantial reductions in fox abundance, then there may be a reduced need for targeted fox control. Conversely, if sustained control of rabbits to low abundance does not limit fox populations (perhaps because alternative prey are exploited when rabbits are scarce), then there may be a need to undertake simultaneous, integrated control of both rabbit and fox populations to protect biodiversity and agricultural production values. We predicted that the effect of rabbit abundance on the rate of increase of foxes would either be positive (as greater rabbit abundance would increase food availability for foxes), or near zero, if the availability of alternative prey sources meant that food did not become limiting when rabbit abundance declined.

Rainfall is an important driver of soil moisture, and hence pasture growth on grazing lands in south-eastern Australia [@sanford2003sgs; @RPGOT]. Low rainfall could therefore limit food availability for mammalian herbivores and their predators [@letnic2004responses]. Current population density may also partly determine the future growth rates of rabbit [@fordham2012european] and fox [@lindstrom1989food] populations through density-dependent mechanisms. 

Computational advances mean that complex population dynamics, including interactions between species, can be evaluated from noisy, complex datasets by fitting hierarchical models to population time series [@buckland2004state]. Such methods have also been applied to predator-prey systems [@hobbs2012native; @sundell2013numerical]. Here, we use a long-term (1998--2016) and spatially extensive monitoring dataset collected from 21 transects in south-eastern Australia occupied by both European rabbits and red foxes to test these hypotheses about the relationships between predator and prey abundances, together with the effects of rainfall, management and density dependence on population growth rates.

#Materials and methods

##Transect locations and management histories

Twenty-one monitoring transects distributed throughout the state of Victoria were included in this study (Fig. 1). All transects were located on freehold livestock and cropping properties, with a single transect on each property. Eighteen transects were established in 1998--1999 to evaluate the impact of RHDV and conventional control on rabbit populations [@mcphee2010long]. Three additional transects were established in 2001, 2007 and 2008. Transect lengths varied from 7.0-21.7 km (Table S1). Since the minimum distance between transects (5.4 km) exceeds the home range sizes of both rabbits and foxes in south-eastern Australia [@williams1995managing; @saunders1995managing], transects were considered demographically independent. The transects encompassed a climatic and productivity gradient from cool, moist, high-productivity sites in the south to hot, dry, low-productivity sites in the north-west (Table S1).

The rabbit management histories of the transects also varied. Following the establishment of RHDV in Victoria in 1996, the Victorian government subsidised rabbit management at 14 of the properties from 1996-2002 [@mcphee2010long].  Management involved using earthmoving machinery to remove surface harbour and destroy warrens [see @mcphee2010long]. Three of the originally established properties were not subjected to this management [@mcphee2010long], although rabbit management was later conducted at one property (Ingliston) in 2010. The removal of surface harbour and ripping of warrens resulted in sustained reductions in rabbit abundance, over and above the effects of RHDV [@mcphee2010long; @ramsey2014recolonisation].

Foxes were not actively managed on any of the 21 properties, except for occasional recreational shooting. Such shooting has little impact on fox populations [@saunders2010impacts].

Monthly rainfalls were compiled for all transects using records from nearby official weather stations obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Where a monthly total for the nearest available weather station was unavailable, data from the next closest station was substituted to construct a complete monthly rainfall record.

##Spotlight counts

Spotlight counts were conducted between two and four times annually, with the majority of counts made during the austral autumn (March-May) and spring (September-November). Two replicate counts were made on most survey occasions, typically on consecutive nights. Counts commenced shortly after sunset, and involved an observer standing in the tray of a slow-moving (10--20 km h^-1^, depending upon terrain) utility vehicle, searching 100 m either side of the transect line with a hand-held 100 W spotlight [@williams1995managing]. The numbers of rabbits and foxes observed along the transects were recorded. 

There is debate about the usefulness of such uncorrected population indices [e.g. @hayward2014will; @nimmo2015forum], but spotlight counts have long been used to monitor rabbits and foxes in Australia [e.g. @pech1992limits; @mutze2010effect], and Europe [e.g. @sobrino2009carnivore and references therein]. For rabbits, spotlight counts are highly correlated with absolute abundance estimates [@marchandeau2006abundance; @ballinger2003validating]. Spotlight counts of red foxes have not been similarly evaluated, perhaps due to the difficulty of estimating absolute fox abundances at appropriate spatial scales [@coman1991home].  

##Statistical model

To account for uneven timing and survey effort amongst transects, the spotlight counts of rabbits and foxes were temporally discretized into half-yearly intervals, depending on whether they were made in the first (January--June) or second (July--December) half of each calendar year. Hence, changes in populations were attributed by the model to either the June--July or December--January periods: these seasonal periods of change are referred to hereafter as 'winter' or 'summer'.

###Process model

We modelled the time-series of semi-annual observations of rabbit and fox abundance from the 21 transects using an hierarchical, Bayesian, state-space model [@buckland2004state]. The model included the effects of rainfall and density dependence on both species, as well as the effects of rabbit abundance on the rate of increase of fox populations [i.e., the numerical response, @bayliss2002numerical].

The prevailing transect-level abundances $(\rho_{jt})$ of rabbits at each transect over the course of the study were modelled as a stochastic, density-dependent process:

\begin{align}
\rho_{jt}=\rho_{jt-1} e^{r_{jt}^{rabbit}}
\end{align}

where $\rho_{jt}$ is the expected mean spotlight count of rabbits at the $j^{th}$ transect at time $t$, and $r_{jt}^{rabbit}$ is the  rate-of-increase for the $j^{th}$ rabbit population during the interval $[t-1,t]$. We decomposed $r_{jt}^{rabbit}$ into components attributable to transect- and time-level covariates using a linear model. The model accounted for density-dependence [a Gompertz model; @cruz2013modelling], rainfall (lagged, see below), season (summer or winter), the effects of rabbit control works, and random transect effects and process errors.

\begin{align}
r_{jt}^{rabbit} &=\bar{r}_{rabbit}  + \beta_{1}\log{\rho_{t-1}} + \beta_{2}\mbox{rain}_{jt} +\beta_{3}\mbox{winter}_{t}+\beta_{4}\mbox{ripped}_{jt} +\zeta_{j}^{rabbit} +\epsilon_{t}^{rabbit}
\end{align}

where $\bar{r}_{rabbit}$ is the mean rate of increase, and $\beta_{1}-\beta_{4}$ are regression parameters describing the strength of density dependence in the rate-of-increase of the rabbit population, the relationship between rate of increase and the lagged rainfall and whether or not the count was made in the second half of the calendar year (denoted as `winter' as such observations reflect population growth over the austral winter). $\zeta_{i}^{rabbit}$ are random transect-level effects with standard deviation $\sigma_{site}^{rabbit}$ on the rate of increase of the rabbit population and $\epsilon_{t}^{rabbit}$ are normally-distributed process errors with standard deviation $\sigma_{process}^{rabbit}$. As  disease impacts on the rate of increase of rabbit populations in south-eastern Australia are at least partially explained by season and climate [e.g. @mutze2008geographic], and density-dependence [@mutze2010effect, @henzell2002factors], we did not explicitly include the influence of disease in our model of rabbit population dynamics.

The abundances of foxes ($\mu_{jt}$) were modelled simultaneously with those of rabbits, using a model similar to that used for rabbits, but including the numerical response of fox populations to rabbit abundance:

\begin{align}
\mu_{t} &=\mu_{t-1} e^{r_{jt}^{fox}} 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
r_{jt}^{fox}=\bar{r}_{fox} + \beta_{5}\log{rab_{jt}} + \beta_{6}\log{\mu_{t-1}}+\beta_{7}\mbox{rain}_{jt}+\beta_{8}\mbox{winter}_{t}+ \zeta_{j}^{fox}+\epsilon_{t}^{fox}
\end{align}

where $\beta_5 - \beta_8$ are regression parameters, $\bar{r}_{fox}$ is the mean rate of increase, ($rab_{jt}$) are the lagged (see below) abundances of rabbits and $\mu_{t-1}$ is the estimated fox abundance at the previous time step. The other model terms (rain, winter) are equivalent to the comparable terms in the model of rabbit abundance (Equation 2, above). 

For both rabbits and foxes, we estimated the appropriate lagging period for the effects of rainfall on rates of increase, and for the numerical response of foxes to the abundance of rabbits. Lagged rainfall was defined as:

\begin{align}
\mbox{rain}_{jt}=\sum_{m=0}^{m=k}  \frac{R_{jtm}}{k}
\end{align}

where $R_{jtm}$ are the series of rainfall totals at each transect in the months $(m)$ preceding each survey, and $k$ is the maximum lag period considered. Increasing values of $k$ imply averaging of antecedent rainfall over an increasingly long period prior to the survey. The maximum lag parameters $k$ were estimated separately for rabbits and foxes. Lagging periods between 1 and 30 months were considered.

Lagged rabbit abundance was defined as:

\begin{align}
\mbox{rab}_{jt}=\sum_{m=0}^{m=k} \frac{\rho_{jtm}}{k}
\end{align}

where $\rho$ are the estimated rabbit abundances at each transect at the preceding $k$ half-yearly surveys. Lagging periods between 0 and 4 half-yearly intervals were considered (i.e. up to 2 calendar years).

###Observation model

Overdispersed, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) observation models were assumed for the counts of both foxes and rabbits. The numbers of rabbits $(C_{ijt}^{rabbit})$ and foxes $(C_{ijt}^{fox})$ observed during each survey were dependent on the underlying abundances of the two species ($\rho_{jt}$ and  $\mu_{jt}$ respectively), with overdispersed, zero-inflated Poisson observation errors. 

Transect lengths were included as offset terms in the observation model to allow for both within- and between-transect variation in the lengths of the spotlight transects (Table S1). For rabbits, the observation model was:

\begin{align}
 \begin{aligned}
C_{ijt}^{rabbit} &\sim \mbox{ZIP}(\lambda^{rabbit}_{ijt}, \mbox{zinf}^{rabbit}) \\
log(\lambda^{rabbit}_{ijt}) &= log(\rho_{jt}) + log(L_{ijt}) + \eta^{rabbit}_{ijt}
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}

where $\lambda^{rabbit}_{ijt}$ is the expected number of rabbits observed during the $i^{th}$ replicate spotlight count, at transect $j$, at time $t$, The corresponding length of transect surveyed was $L_{ijt}$, and $\eta^{fox}_{ijt}$ are normally distributed error terms, with standard deviation $\sigma^{rabbit}_{survey}$. The number of rabbits counted on each survey was modelled as a zero-inflated Poisson, with expectation $\lambda^{rabbit}_{ijt}$, and zero-inflation probability $\mbox{zinf}^{rabbit}$. 

An equivalent zero-inflated and overdispersed Poisson observation model was assumed for counts of foxes:

\begin{align}
 \begin{aligned}
C_{ijt}^{fox} &\sim \mbox{ZIP}(\lambda^{fox}_{ijt}, \mbox{zinf}^{fox}) \\
log(\lambda^{fox}_{ijt}) &= log(\mu_{jt}) + log(L_{ijt}) + \eta^{fox}_{ijt}
   \end{aligned}
\end{align}

### Priors

Weakly informative $\mbox{half-}t_{4}$ priors [@gelman2006prior] were specified for the standard deviations of the process and sampling errors, and for transect-level random effects. Weakly informative Cauchy(0, 2.5) priors [@gelman2008weakly] were specified for the regression parameters relating the rates of increase of foxes and rabbits to the covariates ($\beta$). The lag periods $(k)$ on the demographic responses of rabbits and foxes to rainfall were assigned categorical priors, with equal (uniform) prior weights given to lag periods between 1 and 30 months. The lagging period on the demographic response of foxes to rabbit abundance was given a categorical  prior with a maximum lag period of four half-years (two calendar years). 

### Model fitting and checking

The state-space model was fitted to the data using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software \textsc{JAGS} [@plummerJAGSmanual]. The model's code is provided in Appendix S1. A burn-in of $`r round(NBURN)`$ iterations was undertaken, followed by sampling from four independent Markov chains with different starting values for $`r NITER-NBURN`$ further iterations, retaining every $`r paste0(toOrdinal::toOrdinal(THIN))`$ value. After thinning, a total of $`r (NITER-NBURN)/THIN`$ samples from each chain were retained for inference. The convergence of the MCMC algorithm was assessed using the scale-reduction diagnostic $(\hat R)$ of @brooks1998general, and by visual inspection of parameter trace plots. The fit of the state-space model of fox and rabbit abundances was assessed using posterior predictive checks and Bayesian *p*-values [@gelman1996posterior]. Fo further details see Appendix S2.  

#Results

##Data scope

A total of `r nrow(spotlight)` spotlight counts were conducted across the 21 transects between mid-1998 and mid-2015 (Table S1). There was a steep gradient in mean annual rainfall between the transects, but also wide seasonal and annual variability within transects (Figs. 1 and S1).  The numbers of rabbits observed per spotlight km varied from `r round(min(spotlight$Rabbits/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 1)` to `r round(max(spotlight$Rabbits/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 1)` (mean `r round(mean(spotlight$Rabbits/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 2)`) and foxes from `r round(min(spotlight$Foxes/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 1)` to `r round(max(spotlight$Foxes/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 1)` (mean `r round(mean(spotlight$Foxes/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 2)`) respectively.

##Model assessment

Convergence of the model's parameters was judged to be adequate, with all $\hat{R}\leq$ `r round(max(samp$Rhat$beta, samp$Rhat$sigma, samp$Rhat$fox.lag, samp$Rhat$rabbit.lag, samp$Rhat$food.lag ), digits=2)`. Posterior predictive checks showed good agreement between the model and the data (Appendix S2, Fig. S3).

##Rabbit population dynamics

Rates of increase of rabbit populations showed strong negative density-dependence ($\beta_{1}<0$; Fig. 2, Table S2). Rabbit populations increased more rapidly during the autumn-spring (winter) interval than the spring-autumn (summer) interval ($\beta_{3}>0$; Fig. 2, Table S2). Evidence for a direct effect of rainfall on the rate of increase of rabbit populations was weak, with slightly stronger evidence for a negative effect of rainfall, and the best-supported lag period being approximately six months (Fig. 2, Table S2). The intensive rabbit control activities conducted at 18 of the 21 transects resulted in a consistent reduction in the rate of increase of the rabbit populations ($\beta_{4}<0$; Fig. 2, Table S2). 

##Fox population dynamics

Fox populations also exhibited strong negative density-dependence ($\beta_{6}<0$, Fig. 2, Table S2). Higher rainfalls were followed by higher rates of increase ($\beta_{7}>0$), with the best-supported lag-period for the effect of rainfall being 21 months (Fig. 2, Table S2). There was no evidence of a numerical response of fox populations to rabbit abundance, with the credible interval for this parameter ($\beta_{5}$) easily including zero (Fig. 2, Table S2). 

##Predictive population dynamics

We used the fitted model to predict the expected half-yearly rates of increase of fox populations at a range of plausible fox and rabbit abundances, under high (50 mm), medium (25 mm) and low (10 mm) monthly rainfalls, and for summer and winter seasons (Fig. 3). These predictions illustrate the dominating effects of rainfall and density dependence in determining the rates of increase of fox populations, with no numerical response to rabbit abundance, and relatively minor influences of season. We also estimated the conditions under which fox populations would be at equilibrium for each combination of rainfall and season (i.e. neither increasing nor decreasing, $r = 0$; Fig. 2). Regardless of season or rainfall, or rabbit abundance equilibrium abundances were always < 0.2 foxes per spotlight km (Fig. 3).

The model was also used to infer the likely abundances of foxes and rabbits over the duration of the observations at the transects, and the uncertainty in those estimates (Fig. 4). The inferred abundances were in close concordance with the observed counts, with relatively small uncertainties in the predicted abundances (expressed as 95 % credible intervals). Uncertainties were greatest when monitoring was temporarily or permanently discontinued at some transects: during these periods the predictions of abundance were driven by the expected dynamics of the fitted population model.

#Discussion

There are few long-term studies of the population dynamics of invasive predator-prey systems, and our data are notable because they are spatially and temporally extensive. Our study included a period of severe, prolonged drought [the "Millenium Drought" 2001--2009; @dijk2013millennium], followed by a six year period of high rainfall. Furthermore, intensive rabbit control activities were undertaken at most of the transects, significantly reducing rabbit populations. Hence, substantial variation in rabbit and fox abundances were observed within and between the 21 transects. Our analysis revealed that populations of predators and prey responded to rainfall, management, density and seasonal effects. Relative to these effects, the fox populations showed no evidence of numerical response to changing rabbit abundances. Hence, the prediction that reductions in the abundance of European rabbits would reduce the abundance of red foxes was not supported.

Our study commenced two years after the initial, severe impacts of RHDV had substantially reduced rabbit abundance across the study area [@mutze2010effect; @mcphee2010long]. Most transects were also subjected to intensive rabbit control (warren ripping and removal of surface harbour) during 1998--2002, which further reduced rabbit abundances [@mcphee2010long; @ramsey2014recolonisation]. Our analysis confirms the long-term effectiveness of this intensive control program, which resulted in lower rates of increase in rabbit populations subsequent to the control operations (Figs. 2 and 4). 

Previous studies of fox populations in Australia, and in their native range have demonstrated strong functional responses of foxes to changes in rabbit abundance: foxes consumed less rabbits in both absolute and proportional terms when rabbit abundance declines [e.g. @davey2006exotic; @Ferreras2011116]. However, the existence of a strong functional response to prey abundance cannot be assumed to always lead to a numerical response in the abundance of predators. If predators can readily switch prey when preferred prey become scarce, then a strong functional response might not cause a discernible numerical response. Studies of fox population on both the native European and invasive Australia ranges have shown varying responses to RHDV-induced declines in rabbit abundance, with some reporting no change [@edwards2002population; @davey2006exotic; @sobrino2009carnivore] and others declines in fox abundance [@holden2003impact; @Ferreras2011116]. Hence a numerical response by foxes to rabbit abundance is not universal.

##Rainfall and rabbit-fox population dynamics

Rainfall is a major driver of the abundances of both mammalian herbivores and predators [@dennis2000joint; @letnic2004responses]. Our monitoring transects spanned a gradient from semi-arid to temperate climates. Contrary to expectations [@Pech_alternativeprey], antecedent rainfall had little effect on the rates of increase of rabbit populations. Our analysis cannot elucidate the mechanism(s) generating this result, but there are several possibilities. First, rabbits were subject to other sources of mortality, including infection with RHDV and myxomavirus. Outbreaks of disease could have limited the potential for rabbit populations to increase rapidly under high rainfall conditions, especially as periods of heightened mortality due to RHDV are known to coincide with rabbits' peak breeding season [i.e., late winter and spring @mutze2008geographic; @wells2015timing]. Second, most transects were subject to rabbit control activities. The combined impacts of disease, climatic extremes and rabbit control may have constrained the ability of the rabbit populations to increase in response to high rainfall.  

In contrast to rabbits, antecedent rainfall had a markedly positive effect on rates of increase of fox populations. The effect of rainfall on fox populations was strongly lagged, with a lag-period of 21 months being best supported by the data. Foxes eat a wide range of mammals, reptiles, birds, insectsand plant materials [see @davis_foxdiet], and readily switch food sources as availability changes [@davey2006exotic; @Leckie_preyswitch]. High rainfall may increase the availability of many of these foods, and this in turn may have increased survival and recruitment of foxes. 

##Density-dependence in fox and rabbit populations

Analyses of population time-series show that density dependence is widespread in mammal populations [@sibly2005regulation; @brook2006strength]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly demonstrate density-dependent effects on rates of increase of rabbit and fox populations in Australia. Density-dependent reproduction has been reported in the native range of rabbits [@rodel2004density], and in South Australia density negatively affected survival of juvenile and adult rabbits [@fordham2012european]. In Australia, high-density rabbit populations experience lower rates of survival during RHDV outbreaks [@henzell2002factors]. Furthermore, juvenile rabbits in low density populations have lower prevalences of antibodies to RHDV, suggesting a negative relationship between rabbit density and transmission of RHDV [@mutze2010effect]. Hence, the impacts of disease are likely to be a key mechanism driving density-dependence in rabbit populations. Density-dependence has also been demonstrated in the native range of the red fox [@forchhammer2000invading; @lindstrom1989food] and is thought to arise either from suppression of reproduction in sub-dominant vixens via territoriality, or via reduced fecundity and juvenile survival when food is limiting [@lindstrom1989food]. No previous studies have directly addressed density-dependence in Australian red fox populations, and the relevance of studies from the native range to Australian populations is unclear. 

##Management implications

Controlling prey populations to control invasive predators has long been advocated by applied ecologists [@norbury2017bottomup; @courchamp1999control], but there have been few robust tests of this idea. We find no support for the hypothesis that red fox populations exhibit a positive numerical response to rabbit abundances [@Pech_alternativeprey; @norbury2015pests]. Accordingly, rabbit control (whether conventional or biological) cannot be viewed as a surrogate for fox control. Rather, managers who wish to maintain foxes at low densities to protect agricultural or biodiversity values should implement fox control independently of rabbit control. As foxes may increase their consumption of alternative prey following large reductions in rabbit density [@holden2003impact; @Ferreras2011116], a risk-averse approach for managers wishing to limit unintentional impacts on threatened prey would be to increase fox control following large reductions in rabbit abundance. Our finding that fox abundances increased more rapidly in response to high rainfall means that managers wishing to maintain foxes at low abundances in south-eastern Australia should initiate or intensify fox control operations in response to periods of high rainfall.

Few studies have demonstrated a positive numerical response of invasive predators to invasive prey are few [@cruz2013modelling]. Specialist predators of invasive prey may be more susceptible to indirect control targeting prey due to their limited capacity for prey-switching [@harper2005numerical]. Conversely, generalist predators may be much more tolerant of scarcity of preferred prey, and respond by prey-switching, limiting any numerical response to the change in abundance of preferred prey. The results of our study fall within this latter category, in which a generalist invasive predator, with large dietary breadth [@davis_foxdiet] shows no evidence of numerical response to changes in the abundance of a preferred prey.

Our results should encourage managers of invasive predator-prey systems to critically evaluate management strategies that are underpinned by an assumption of bottom-up regulation of predator populations. Devising management strategies under such assumptions, could lead to less effective population control, and sub-optimal allocation of resources to alternative control actions. Quantifying the numerical response is critical to understanding the likely response of invasive predators to changes in invasive prey abundance.

![Predicted rates of increase *(r)* for fox populations under varying rabbit and fox abundances (counts per spotlight km). Predictions are given for the austral summer and winter half-yearly intervals, and under low (10 mm), medium (25 mm) and high (50 mm) monthly rainfalls.  The solid lines denote combinations of rabbit and fox abundances at which *r* = 0. The red regions of the graph are conditions in which fox populations are predicted to decline.](Figures/predicted_fox_r.png)

![Predicted (line) and observed (points) relative abundances (spotlight counts per transect km) of foxes (lower orange line/ open triangles) and rabbits (upper blue line / closed circles) at each of the 21 transects during the study. Transects are arranged in order of increasing rainfall. Solid lines are posterior medians, and shaded polygons are the 95% credible intervals of expected abundances. Vertical dashed lines denote the time of completion of major rabbit control operations at 18 of the transects. The shaded region of the graph denotes the approximate limits of the historically severe Millenium Drought in south-eastern Australia (2001-2009). Note that y-axes are of logarithmic scale.](Figures/fox_abund.png)
