#Summary

1. Managing the abundance of both predators and prey is often difficult because of uncertainty regarding the effects of trophic and competitive interactions between species. Invasive red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*) and European rabbit (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*) are sympatric across 69 %  of mainland Australia, but there is uncertainty about the effects of changes in rabbit abundance on the dynamics of fox populations, relative to the effects of environmental variation and density-dependent population processes. 

2. We examined how rates of increase of fox populations responded to changes in rabbit abundance by fitting an hierarchical state-space model to regular spotlight counts of both species conducted at 21 vehicle transects throughout the State of Victoria between 1998 and 2015. The effects of rainfall and density dependence on the population growth rates of both species were also evaluated. 

3. There was no evidence of a numerical response of foxes to changes in rabbit abundance. Rather, fox populations increased with increasing rainfall, and exhibited strongly negative density dependence. In contrast, rabbit populations showed little response to rainfall while exhibiting strongly negative density dependence and greater rates of increase over the autumn-spring interval. Our model predicts that the mean equilibrium abundance of fox populations was < 0.25 foxes per spotlight km. 

4. *Synthesis and applications.* Our analysis provides the first quantitative evidence of density dependence in Australian fox populations, but showed little evidence that abundance of foxes is driven by the availability of rabbits. We conclude that fox and rabbit abundances are determined by the interaction between rainfall, season and prevailing density, and that there is little numerical interaction between the species. As controlling rabbits to very low abundances is not expected to substantially reduce fox abundances in south-eastern Australia, targeted control of fox populations will be necessary if reductions in fox abundance are desired by managers.

#Introduction

Simultaneously managing the abundance of predators and prey is difficult because of the complex, and potentially unpredictable trophic and competitive interactions that are possible in such systems [@ruscoe2011unexpected; @bode2015eradicating]. For example, there was much debate about the preferred order in which to eradicate invasive feral cats *(Felis catus)* and European rabbits *(Oryctolagus cuniculus)* from Macquarie Island [@bergstrom2009indirect; @dowding2009cats]. Although eradication of invasive mammalian predators and prey is now technically feasible for smaller islands [@bode2015eradicating], sustained control to low densities is currently the only feasible management option for larger islands and continents [@ruscoe2011unexpected; @glen2013eradicating]. The need to rely on sustained control adds to the complexity of the decision-making process, as managers with limited resources may have to continually evaluate the costs and benefits of controlling predators, prey or both in order to achieve desired management outcomes.

Because there are often insufficient resources to simultaneously control multiple invasive taxa, a key question for managers is whether controlling only the predator or only the prey affects the abundance of the other species [i.e. via a numerical response, @bayliss2002numerical]. Because of the typically much smaller home-ranges of mammalian prey compared to predators, this question can be addressed by using field experiments in which free-living predators have access to some experimental units containing prey but not others [@pech1992limits].  Field experiments that have excluded mammalian predators sometimes demonstrate significant increases in mammalian prey [@krebs1995impact; @salo2010predator], although the responses in invasive predator-prey systems are often weak or non-existent  [e.g. @pech1992limits; @davey2006exotic; @norbury2015pests]. Bottom-up processes such as food availability, often have stronger positive effects on mammalian prey abundances than the negative effect of mammalian predators [@krebs1995impact;  @prevedello2013population].

In contrast, the abundance of mammalian predators is believed to be primarily determined by food availability (a bottom-up process), although there may be a ceiling on this effect due to territorial spacing or other behavioural constraints on abundance at high densities [@macdonald1983ecology; @lindstrom1989food; @cariappa2011reappraisal]. Because mammalian predators often operate at large spatial and temporal scales, experiments to test hypotheses about the ecological processes driving the abundance of predators are practically and financially difficult to implement [@krebs1995impact]. Statistical analysis of long-term monitoring data from predator-prey systems provides an alternative approach to testing hypotheses about the outcomes of predator-prey interaction [e.g. @dennis2000joint; @meserve2003thirteen]. An advantage of long-term population monitoring data is that the influence of additional factors that vary temporally and geographically can also be assessed. For example, rainfall can be an important driver of food availability for mammalian prey and/or predators, particularly in semi-arid and arid environments [@dennis2000joint; @meserve2003thirteen; @letnic2004responses; @letnic2011resources]. 

The European rabbit *(Oryctolagus cuniculus)*  and red fox *(Vulpes vulpes)* are sympatric over c. 69 % of mainland Australia [@west2011australian], and are serious threats to agricultural production and native biodiversity [@mcleod2004counting; @cooke2012rabbits; @saunders2010impacts]. Substantial effort is expended on the control of both species using conventional methods such as warren ripping (for rabbits) and poison baiting (for both species) [@reddiex2007control]. Two biological control agents (myxoma virus and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus [hereafter RHDV]) have also been established to control rabbits [@fenner1999biological; @mutze2008geographic; @mutze2010effect].  Because rabbits are a major component of fox diet in south-eastern Australia [@davis_foxdiet], there is much interest in understanding the interactions between these species [@Pech_alternativeprey; @norbury2015pests], and in exploiting these interactions to maximise the effectiveness of management for achieving agricultural production and native biodiversity outcomes [@pedler2016rabbit].

Of particular management interest is the effect of controlling rabbits to low densities (either through conventional or biological control) on fox populations [@pech1992limits; @holden2003impact]. If controlling rabbits to low densities results in substantial reductions in fox abundance, then there may be reduced need for targeted fox control. Conversely, if sustained control of rabbits to low abundance does not limit fox populations (perhaps because alternative prey are exploited when rabbits are scarce), then there may be a need to undertake simultaneous, integrated control of both rabbit and fox populations to protect biodiversity and agricultural production values. We predicted that the effect of rabbit abundance on the rate of increase of foxes would either be positive (as greater rabbit abundance would result in improved prey availability for foxes), or close to zero, if the availability of alternative prey sources meant that food did not become limiting when rabbit populations declined.

Rainfall is a driver of vegetation growth and availability in Australia \todo{add rainfall effect on veg refs.}, and hence may ultimately drive food availability for both mammalian herbivores and their predators [e.g. @letnic2004responses; @letnic2011resources]. We predicted that rabbit and fox population growth rates would both respond positively to rainfall, lagged over an appropriate antecedent period [@Pech_alternativeprey]. Finally, current population density may also partly determine the future growth rates of rabbit [@fordham2012european] and fox [@lindstrom1989food; @saunders2010impacts] populations, through density dependent mechanisms. Hence, we also predicted that both rabbit and fox populations would exhibit negative density dependence [*sensu* @brook2006strength].

Computational advances mean that hypotheses concerning complex population dynamics can be evaluated from noisy, complex datasets by fitting hierarchical models to time series of abundance [e.g. @bjornstad2001noisy; @buckland2004state; @new2012modelling]. Here, we use a long-term (1998--2016) and spatially extensive monitoring dataset collected from 21 sites in south-eastern Australia occupied by both European rabbits and red foxes to test these hypotheses about the relationships between predator and prey abundances, together with the effects of rainfall and density dependence on population growth rates.

#Materials and methods

##Transect locations and management histories

Twenty-one monitoring transects distributed throughout the state of Victoria were included in this study (Fig. 1). All transects were located on private livestock and cropping properties, with a single transect located on each property. Eighteen of these transects were established in 1998--199 to evaluate the impact of RHDV and conventional control on rabbit populations [@mcphee2010long]. An additional three transects were added to the study in 2001, 2007 and 2008. The transects were permanently marked, and varied in length from 7.0 - 21.7 km (Table S1). Since the minimum distance between transects (5.4 km) exceeds the home range sizes of both rabbits and foxes in south-eastern Australia [@williams1995managing; @saunders1995managing; @carter2012ecology], the transects were treated as demographically independent. The 21 transects encompassed a climatic and productivity gradient from cool, moist, highly productive sites in the south to hot, dry, low-productivity sites in the north-west (Table S1). 

The rabbit management history of transects varied. Following the establishment of RHDV in Victoria in 1996, the Victorian government subsidised rabbit management at 14 of the properties from 1996 - 2002 [@mcphee2010long].  Management involved using heavy machinery to remove surface harbour and destroy warrens [for further details see @mcphee2010long]. Three of the originally established properties were deliberately not subjected to this management [@mcphee2010long], although rabbit management was later conducted at one of these properties (Ingliston) from 2010 [@forsyth_density-dependent_2015]. The removal of surface harbour and ripping of warrens resulted in sustained reductions in rabbit abundance over and above the effects of RHDV [@mcphee2010long; @ramsey2014recolonisation].

Foxes were not systematically managed on any of the 21 properties, except for occasional recreational shooting. Such shooting has little impact on fox populations [@saunders2010impacts; @saunders1995managing].

Monthly rainfall records were compiled for all transects using data from nearby official weather stations, obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Where a monthy total for the nearest available weather station was unavailable, data from the next closest station was substituted to obtain a complete monthly rainfall record.

##Spotlight counts

Spotlight counts were conducted between two and four times annually, with the majority of counts made during the austral autumn (March-May) and spring (September-November). Two replicate counts were usually made on each survey occasion, typically on consecutive nights. Counts commenced shortly after sunset, and involved a single observer standing in the tray of a slow-moving (10--20 km h^-1^, depending upon terrain) utility vehicle, searching 100 m either side of the transect line with a hand-held 100 W spotlight [@williams1995managing]. The numbers of rabbits and foxes observed along the transects were recorded. 

##Statistical model
We modelled the time-series of fox and rabbit counts from the 21 transects using an hierarchical, Bayesian, state-space model [@buckland2004state]. To account for uneven timing and survey effort amongst sites, the spotlight counts of rabbits and foxes were temporally discretized into half-yearly intervals, depending on whether they were made in the first (January--June) or second (July--December) half of each calendar year. Hence, changes in populations were attributed by the model to either the June--July or December--January periods: hereafter these seasonal periods of change are referred to as 'winter' or 'summer'.

A Poisson observation model was assumed for the counts of both foxes and rabbits, where the number of individuals observed during each survey was dependent on underlying abundance, with a Poisson errors for the observations. Transect lengths were included in the expectation of the Poisson model to allow for both within- and between-site variation in the lengths of the spotlight transects. For foxes, the observation model was:

$$
F_{ijt} \sim Poisson(\mu_{jt}L_{ijt})
$$

where $F_{ijt}$ is the number of foxes observed during the $i^{th}$ replicate spotlight count, at transect $j$, at time $t$. The corresponding lengths of transect surveyed during each survey was $L_{ijt}$. 

The prevailing transect-level abundances $(\mu_{jt})$ of foxes at each site over the course of the study were modelled as a stochastic, density-dependent process:

$$
\mu_{jt}=\mu_{jt-1} e^{r_{jt}^{fox}}
$$

where $\mu_{jt}$ is the expected mean spotlight count of the $j^{th}$ transect at time $t$, and $r_{jt}^{fox}$ is the  rate-of-increase for the $j^{th}$ population during the interval $[t-1,t]$. We decomposed $r_{jt}^{fox}$ into components attributable to transect and survey-level covariates using a linear model. The model accounted for a numerical response to prey (rabbit) abundance [@bayliss2002numerical], density-dependence [a Gompertz model; @cruz2013modelling], rainfall (lagged, see below), season (summer or winter), and random transect effects and process errors.

$$
r_{jt}^{fox}=\bar{r}_{fox} + \beta_{1}\log{\mbox{rab}_{t}} + \beta_{2}\log{\mu_{t-1}}+\beta_{3}\mbox{rain}_{jt}+\beta_{4}\mbox{winter}_{t}+ \zeta_{j}^{fox}+\epsilon_{t}^{fox}
$$

where $\bar{r}_{fox}$ is the mean rate of increase, $\mbox{rab}_{t}$ is the (lagged, see below) estimated of abundance of rabbits at during the months prior to the census, and $\beta_{1}-\beta_{4}$ are regression parameters describing respectively the numerical response of the fox population to rabbit abundance, the strength of density dependence in the rate-of-increase of the fox population, the relationship between rate of increase and the lagged rainfall, and whether or not the count was made in the second half of the calendar year. $\zeta_{i}^{fox}$ are random site-level effects with standard deviation $\sigma_{site}^{fox}$ on the rate of increase of the fox population and $\epsilon_{t}^{fox}$ are normally-distributed process errors with standard deviation $\sigma_{process}^{fox}$.

The counts of rabbits ($R_{ijt}$) were modelled jointly with those of foxes, using a state-space approach similar to that used for foxes, but without a term for numerical response of the rabbit populations to prey availability: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{ijt} &\sim Poisson(\rho_{jt}L_{ijt}) \\
\rho_{t} &=\rho_{t-1} e^{r_{jt}^{rabbit}} 
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
r_{jt}^{rabbit} &=\bar{r}_{rabbit}  + \beta_{5}\log{\rho_{t-1}} + \beta_{6}\mbox{rain}_{jt} +\beta_{7}\mbox{winter}_{t}+\beta_{8}\mbox{ripped}_{jt} +\zeta_{j}^{rabbit} +\epsilon_{t}^{rabbit}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $R_{ijt}$ are the rabbit counts, $\rho_{jt}$ are the lagged estimated abundances of rabbits, and the other model terms are equivalent to the comparable terms in the model of fox abundance.  

For both rabbits and foxes, we used a distributed lag approach to estimate the appropriate lagging period for the effects of rainfall on rates of increase, and for the numerical response of foxes to the abundance of rabbits. Lagged rainfall was defined as:

$$
\mbox{rain}_{jt}=\sum_{m=0}^{m=k}  \frac{r_{jtm}}{k}
$$

Where $r_{jtm}$ are the series of rainfall totals at each site in the months $(m)$ preceding each census, and $k$ is the maximum lag period considered. Increasing values of $k$ imply averaging of antecendent rainfall over an increasingly long period prior to the census. The maximum lag parameters $k$ were estimated separately for rabbits and foxes, as it was considered likely that the demographic responses of the two species to rainfall would differ. Lagging periods between 1 and 30 months were considered in the model-fitting process.

Lagged rabbit abundance was defined as:

$$
\mbox{rab}_{jt}=\sum_{m=0}^{m=k} \frac{\rho_{jtm}}{k}
$$

Where $\rho$ are the estimated rabbit abundances at each site at the preceding $k$ half-yearly censuses. Lagging periods between 0 and 4 half-yearly intervals were considered (i.e. up to 2 calendar years).

##Model fitting and priors\todo{check priors against code}
Models were fitted to the data using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software \textsc{JAGS} [@plummerJAGSmanual]. The \textsc{JAGS} code for the model is given in Appendix S1. Weakly informative uniform priors ($U(0, 5)$) were specified for the process errors and transect-level random effects, and vague $\mbox{Normal}(0, 0.01)$ priors were specified for the regression parameters relating the rates of increase to the covariates ($\beta$). The lagging periods $(k)$ on the demographic response to rainfall for each species were assigned categorical (uniform integer) priors, with equal prior weights given to maximum lag periods between 1 and 30 months. Similarly, the lagging period on the demographic response of foxes to rabbit abundance was given a categorical (uniform integer) prior with a maximum lag period of 4 half-years (2 calendar years). The convergence of the MCMC algorithm was assessed using the scale-reduction diagnostic of @brooks1998general, and by visual inspection of parameter traceplots. A burn-in of 30,000 iterations was undertaken, followed by sampling from three independent Markov chains with different starting values for 40,000 further iterations. After thinning, a total of 4,000 samples from each of the three chains were retained for inference.

#Results

##Data overview

A total of `r nrow(spotlight)` spotlight counts were conducted across the 21 transects between mid-1998 and mid-2015 (Table S1). There was a steep gradient in mean annual rainfall between the transects, but also wide seasonal and annual variability within transects (Figs 1 and S1).  Numbers of foxes observed during spotlight counts varied from `r round(min(spotlight$Foxes/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 1)` to `r round(max(spotlight$Foxes/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 1)` per spotlight km and rabbits from `r round(min(spotlight$Rabbits/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 1)` to `r round(max(spotlight$Rabbits/(spotlight$TransectLength/1000)), 1)` per spotlight km, respectively.\todo{consider adding site means of rabbit and fox abundances} 

##Determinants of the rate of increase of rabbits

\todo{rewrite whole paragraph}Three variables had significant effects on the rate of increase of rabbits: rabbit abundance in the preceding 12 months, season  and rainfall (Table 2, Fig S2). Rabbit abundance in the preceding six months had a strongly negative effect on the rate of increase (i.e. negative density-dependence, Table 2, Fig S2). After accounting for the effects of both rabbit abundance and lagged rainfall, rates of increase of rabbits were significantly higher during autumn to spring than from spring to autumn ($\beta_{7}>0$, Table 2, Fig S2). 

##Determinants of the rate of increase of foxes

\todo{rewrite whole paragraph}There was little evidence that rabbit abundance had a positive effect on the rate of increase of foxes, with the 95 % CI for this parameter including zero ($\beta_{1}$, Table 2 and Fig S1). However, there was a strongly negative effect of fox abundance in the preceding six months on the rate of increase of foxes, with the 95 % CI for this parameter being much less than zero ($\beta_{2}$, Table 2, Fig S2). The amount of rainfall in the preceding 12 months had a positive effect on the rate of increase of foxes ($\beta_{3}$, Table 2 and Fig S2). 

Combining the above inferences, we were able to predict the expected rate of increase of fox populations under a range of fox and rabbit abundances, varying rainfall, and in summer and winter (Fig 2). These predictions illustrate the dominating effects of density dependence on the prevailing rates of increase of fox populations, with only a very weak numerical response to rabbit abundance, and only negligible influences of rainfall and season. We also estimated the conditions under which fox populations would be at equilibrium (i.e. $r = 0$; Fig 2). Regardless of prevailing conditions (season, or rainfall), or the abundance of rabbits, equilibrium abundances were always < 0.25 foxes per spotlight km (Fig 2). However, this inference ignores the effects of the transect-level random effects in the model, and hence should be interpreted as the approximate equilibrium density for an average transect.


We used the best supported model to infer the likely abundances of foxes and rabbits over the duration of the observations at all 21 sites, and the uncertainty in these estimates (Figures 3 and 4). The predictions revealed wide variation in rabbit and fox abundances, with periods of increase, decline and fluctuation during the 17 years of monitoring. In general the predictions of the model were in close concordance with the observed counts, with relatively small uncertainties (expressed as 95 % credible intervals). The uncertainties were greatest when monitoring did not occur at some sites; during these periods the predictons are inferred mainly from the process model rather than from the direct observations of abundance.

#Discussion

There are few long-term studies of the population dynamics of invasive predator-prey systems, and our time series are notable because they are both spatially and temporally extensive (21 transects throughout the State of Victoria, and conducted over a period of 17 years). The conditions during our study included wet and dry summers and winters, and widely varying rabbit and fox abundances. Our analysis revealed that the abundances of rabbits and foxes responded to rainfall (albeit in different ways), density dependence, and seasonal effects. Relative to these effects, rabbit abundances had only a weak influence on the growth rates of fox populations. 

##Rabbit and fox spotlight-count abundances

The predicted equilibrium abundance of foxes in our study was < 0.25 foxes per spotlight km, regardless of prevailing prey abundance, season or rainfall (Fig. 2). This is a lower abundance than has been recorded in other parts of Australia prior to the establishment of RHDV in 1996--1998 [@saunders1995managing]. Our data were collected after the initial impacts of RHDV on rabbit abundances had run their course [@mutze2010effect; @mcphee2010long]\todo{give some numbers}, and most of the transects had been subjected to intensive rabbit control (removal of surface harbour and warren ripping) during 1998-2002, which resulted in sustained reductions in rabbit abundances [@mcphee2010long; @ramsey2014recolonisation]. It is possible that the absence of a significant numerical response of foxes to rabbits was partly due to our monitoring period coinciding with a period when rabbit abundances were at historically low levels. If our study had been conducted when rabbit abundances were markedly higher (such as prior to the arrival of RHDV), fox populations may have been able to increase to higher abundances than were observed during our study period, and a positive numerical response to rabbit abundance may have been detectable in the data. 

The transect-based spotlight counts that we analysed are uncorrected indices of abundance. Although there is debate about the usefulness of such uncorrected population indices [e.g. @hayward2014will; @nimmo2015forum], spotlight counts have long been used to monitor rabbits and foxes in Australia [e.g. @pech1992limits; @saunders1995managing; @williams1995managing; @mutze2010effect], and it was infeasible to use other methods in our monitoring program. For rabbits, spotlight counts are highly correlated with absolute abundance estimates [@marchandeau2006abundance; @barrio2010assessment], including at one of our monitoring transects [@ballinger2003validating]. Spotlight counts of red foxes have not been similarly evaluated, perhaps due to the difficulty of estimating absolute fox abundances at appropriate spatial scales [@coman1991home].  

##Rainfall and rabbit/fox population dynamics

Rainfall is thought to be a driver of the abundances of mammalian herbivores and predators in semi-arid and arid systems worldwide [@dennis2000joint; @letnic2004responses; @shaw2012population]. Our 21 monitoring transects included a wide range of mean annual rainfalls (Figs 1 and S1), spanning a gradient from semi-arid to temperate climates. Contrary\todo{add Spanish paper on rainfall and rabbits to Discussion} to expectations [@Pech_alternativeprey], antecedent rainfall had a negative effect on the rates of increase of rabbit populations, after other sources of variation in the model were accounted for. Our analysis provides little direct basis for determining the mechanism behind this result, but several hypotheses seem plausible. Firstly, during the course of the study, rabbits at all sites were subject to other sources of mortality, including infection with RHDV and myxomavirus. Outbreaks of disease may have limited the potential for rabbit populations to grow rapidly under high rainfall conditions, especially as periods of heightened mortality due to RHDV are known to coincide with rabbits' peak breeding season [late winter and spring @mutze2008geographic; @wells2015timing]. Secondly, many of the transects were subject to management of rabbit numbers (mainly warren ripping and removal of surface harbour) throughout the period of this study. The combined impact of disease, climatic extremes, and conventional control may have limited the ability of the rabbit populations to increase during periods of high rainfall. Finally, periods of especially high rainfall have been associated with mortality of rabbits attributable to drowning (especially of dependant young) in their warrens [@bowen1998population; @robson1993natural; @thompson1994european], providing a measure of negative feedback in the relationship between rainfall and rabbit abundance, though this latter mechanism may only be of relevance in temperate environments with very high rainfalls.

In contrast with rabbits, antecedent rainfall had a positive effect on rates of increase of fox populations. Foxes are omnivores, eating a wide range of mammal, reptile, bird, insect and plant material [for south-eastern Australia, see @davis_foxdiet], and readily switch between food sources as availability changes [@delibes2008feeding; @holden2003impact; @davey2006exotic; @Kjellander_preyswit; @Leckie_preyswitch]. It is probable that periods of high rainfall lead to increased availability of many of these foods (with the possible exception of rabbits), and that this in turn leads to increased survival and recruitment, although data on the availability of alternative food sources in our study system are lacking.

##Density-dependence in fox and rabbit populations

Analyses of time series of abundance have revealed that density dependence is widespread in mammal populations [@sibly2005regulation; @brook2006strength], but to our knowledge this is the first study to directly demonstrate negative effects of abundance on the rates of increase of either rabbit or fox populations in Australia. Density-dependent reproduction has been reported in the native range of rabbits [@rodel2004density], and in South Australia adult rabbit density negatively affected kitten and adult rabbit survival rates [@fordham2012european]. There is also evidence that RHDV has a negative density-dependent effect on rabbit abundances in south-eastern Australia [@mutze2010effect]. Density-dependence in the red fox is thought to arise from suppression of reproduction in sub-dominant vixens via territoriality [@lindstrom1989food; @saunders1995managing], but other mechanisms such as competition for food are also plausible\todo{anything on DD in fox native range? other canids?}.

##Seasonal changes in rabbit and fox abundances

The seasonal changes we observed in rabbit and fox rates of increase are consistent with their reproductive biologies in south-eastern Australia. The peak of rabbit breeding in south-eastern Australia is during late winter and spring, with low survival of kittens born in summer and autumn. Hence, increases in rabbit populations are most likely to be observed over the winter-spring months [@williams1995managing; @bowen1998population; @fordham2012european; @wells2016environmental]. Conversely, foxes breed during the austral spring, with cubs emerging from their dens in late spring and early summer and being weaned soon after [@coman1991home; @saunders1995managing]. Accordingly, increases in fox abundance due to favourable conditions for reproduction should be most readily observable from differences in consecutive surveys that span the summer months. 

##Management implications

Our study tested the hypothesis that fox populations exhibit a positive numerical response to rabbit abundances [@Pech_alternativeprey; @norbury2015pests]. We found little support for this hypothesis. An important management implication of this result is that rabbit control [whether conventional or biological; @cooke2003rabbit; @mutze2010effect; @ramsey2014recolonisation] should not be viewed as a surrogate for fox control. Rather, managers who wish to maintain foxes at low densities to protect agricultural values [e.g. @saunders2003observations] or biodiversity [e.g. @robley2014long; @pedler2016rabbit] should probably implement fox control independently of rabbit control. However, as foxes may increase their consumption of alternative prey following large reductions in rabbit density [@holden2003impact; @delibes2008feeding; @Ferreras2011116], a risk-averse approach for managers wishing to limit unintentional impacts on threatened prey of foxes would be to increase fox control following large reductions in rabbit abundance, whatever their causes. Whether a proactive or reactive approach to fox control should be favoured likely depends on the relationships between costs and effectiveness of control, and the response of the protected assets (threatened species or livestock) to reductions in fox abundance. Our finding that fox abundances increased more rapidly in response to high rainfall means that managers wishing to maintain foxes at low abundances in south-eastern Australia will need to be cognisant of prevailing climatic conditions and adjust control regimes accordingly. Initiating or intensifying fox control operations in response to periods of high rainfall may be appropriate.
